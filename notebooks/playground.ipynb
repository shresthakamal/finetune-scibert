for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles S1 Scope This standard establishes performance requirements for pedestrian alert sounds for motor vehicles S2 Purpose The purpose of this standard is to reduce the number of injuries that result from electric and hybrid vehicle crashes with pedestrians by providing a sound level and sound characteristics necessary for these vehicles to be detected and recognized by pedestrians S3 Application This standard applies to a Electric vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating GVWR of 4536 Kg or less that are passenger cars multipurpose passenger vehicles trucks or buses b Hybrid vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating GVWR of 4536 Kg or less that are passenger cars multi purpose passenger vehicles trucks or buses and 119 3142017 eCFR Code of Federal Regulations c Electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles that are low speed vehicles S4 Definitions Band or onethird octave band means one of thirteen onethird octave bands having nominal center frequencies ranging from 315 to 5000Hz These are Bands 25 through 37 as defined in Table A1 Midband Frequencies for OneThirdOctaveBand and OctaveBand Filters in the Audio Range of ANSI S1112004 Specification for Octave Band and FractionalOctaveBand Analog and Digital Filters incorporated by reference see 5715 Band sum means the combination of Sound Pressure Levels SPLs from selected bands that produce an SPL representing the sound in all of these bands Band sum is calculated with the following equation View or download PDF where SPLi is the sound pressure level in each selected band Electric vehicle means a motor vehicle with an electric motor as its sole means of propulsion Front plane of the vehicle means a vertical plane tangent to the leading edge of the vehicle during forward operation Hybrid vehicle means a motor vehicle which has more than one means of propulsion for which the vehicles propulsion system can propel the vehicle in the normal travel mode in at least one forward drive gear or reverse without the internal combustion engine operating Rear plane means a vertical plane tangent to the leading edge of the rear of the vehicle during operation in reverse

to the measurement zone established in paragraph c1i of this section As used in this section seating surface width is the maximum horizontal width of a seating surface determined by the following procedure i Establish a measurement zone bounded by two vertical planes oriented perpendicular to the direction the seat is facing One is located 150 mm 59 inches behind the front leading surface of the seat and the other is located 250 mm 98 inches behind the front leading surface of the seat A measurement location within this zone is any vertical plane parallel to the planes establishing the boundary of the zone ii For each measurement location within the zone establish vertical reference planes parallel to the direction the seat faces that intersect the most outboard point on each side of the seating surface at that measurement location If outboard interior trim contacts the top surface of the seat cushion establish another vertical plane parallel to the direction the seat faces that intersects the most inboard point of contact between outboard interior trim and the top surface of the seat cushion iii For measurement within the zone measure horizontally between and perpendicular to the most inboard vertical reference planes established in ii as shown in Figure 1 provided for illustration purposes 2 Adjacent seating surfaces are considered to form a single continuous seating surface whose overall width is measured as specified in c1 of this section unless i The seating surfaces are separated by A A fixed trimmed surface whose top surface is unpadded and

illumination of motor vehicle controls telltales and indicators S2 Purpose The purpose of this standard is to ensure the accessibility visibility and recognition of motor vehicle controls telltales and indicators and to facilitate the proper selection of controls under daylight and nighttime conditions in order to reduce the safety hazards caused by the diversion of the drivers attention from the driving task and by mistakes in selecting controls S3 Application This standard applies to passenger cars multipurpose passenger vehicles trucks and buses S4 Definitions Adjacent with respect to a control telltale or indicator and its identifier means a The identifier is in close proximity to the control telltale or indicator and b No other control telltale indicator identifier or source of illumination appears between the identifier and the telltale indicator or control that the identifier identifies Common space means an area on which more than one telltale indicator identifier or other message may be displayed but not simultaneously Control means the handoperated part of a device that enables the driver to change the state or functioning of the vehicle or a vehicle subsystem Indicator means a device that shows the magnitude of the physical characteristics that the instrument is designed to sense Identifier means a symbol word or words used to identify a control telltale or indicator Multifunction control means a control through which the driver may select and affect the operation of more than one vehicle function Multitask display means a display on which more than one message can be shown simultaneously Telltale means an optical signal that when illuminated indicates the actuation of a device a correct or improper functioning or condition or a failure to function S5 Requirements Each passenger car multipurpose passenger vehicle truck and bus that is fitted with a control a telltale or an indicator listed in Table 1 or Table 2 must meet the

to a driver under the conditions of S561 and S562 S513 Except as provided in S514 the identification for controls telltales and indicators must be placed on or adjacent to the telltale indicator or control that it identifies S514 The requirement of S513 does not apply to a multifunction control provided the multifunction control is associated with a multitask display that a Is visible to the driver under the conditions of S561 and S562 b Identifies the multifunction control with which it is associated graphically or using words c For multitask displays with layers identifies on the topmost layer each system for which control is possible from the associated multifunction control including systems not otherwise regulated by this standard Subfunctions of the available systems need not be shown on the topmost layer of the multitask display and d Identifies the controls of Table 1 and Table 2 with the identification specified in those tables or otherwise required by this standard whenever those are the active functions of the multifunction control For lower levels of multitask displays with layers identification is permitted but not required for systems not otherwise regulated by this standard e Does not display telltales listed in Table 1 or Table 2 S52 Identification S521 Except for the Low Tire Pressure Telltale each control telltale and indicator that is listed in column 1 of Table 1 or Table 2 must be identified by the symbol specified for it in column 2 or the word or abbreviation specified for it in column 3 of Table 1 or Table 2 If a symbol is used each symbol provided pursuant to this paragraph must be substantially similar in form to the symbol as it appears in Table 1 or Table 2 If a symbol is used each symbol provided pursuant to this paragraph must have the proportional dimensional characteristics of the symbol as it appears in Table 1 or Table 2 The Low Tire Pressure Telltale either the display identifying which tire has low pressure or the display which does not identify which tire has low pressure shall be identified by the appropriate symbol designated in column 4 or both the symbol in column 4 and the words in column 3 No identification is required for any horn ie audible warning signal that is activated by a lanyard or by the driver pressing on the center of the face plane of the steering wheel hub or for a turn signal control that is operated in a plane essentially parallel to the face plane of the steering wheel in its normal driving position and which is located on the left side of the steering column so that it is the control on that side of the column nearest to the steering wheel face plane However if identification is provided for a horn control in the center of the face plane of the steering wheel hub the identifier must meet Table 2 requirements for the horn S522 Any symbol word or abbreviation not shown in Table 1 or Table 2 may be used to identify a control a telltale or an indicator that is not listed in those tables S523 Supplementary symbols words or abbreviations may be used at the manufacturers discretion in conjunction with any symbol word or abbreviation specified in Table 1 or Table 2 S524 Reserved S525 A single symbol word or abbreviation may be used to identify any combination of the control indicator and telltale for the same function S526 Except as provided in S527 all identifications of telltales indicators and controls listed in Table 1 or Table 2 must appear to the driver to be perceptually upright A rotating control that has an off position shall appear to the driver perceptually upright when the rotating control is in the off position S527 The identification of the following items need not appear to the driver to be perceptually upright a A horn control b Any control telltale or indicator located on the steering wheel when the steering wheel is positioned for the motor vehicle to travel in a direction other than straight forward and c Any rotating control that does not have an off position S528 Each control for an automatic vehicle speed system cruise control and each control for heating and air conditioning systems must have identification provided for each function of each such system S529 Each control that regulates a system function over a continuous range must have identification provided for the limits of the adjustment range of that function If color coding is used to identify the limits of the adjustment range of a temperature function the hot limit must be identified by the color red and the cold limit by the color blue If the status or limit of a function is shown by a display not adjacent to the control for that function both the control unless it is a multifunction control complying with S514 and the display must be independently identified as to the function of the control in compliance with S521 on or adjacent to the control and on or adjacent to the display Example 1 A slide lever controls the temperature of the air in the vehicle heating system over a continuous range from no heat to maximum heat Since the control regulates a single function over a quantitative range only the extreme positions require identification Example 2 A switch has three positions for heat defrost and air conditioning Since each position regulates a different function each position must be identified S53 Illumination S531 Timing of illumination a Except as provided in S531c the identifications of controls for which the word Yes is specified in column 5 of Table 1 must be capable of being illuminated

each position S122 The 3point linear spherometer has two outer fixed legs 38 mm apart and one inner movable leg at the midpoint The spherometer has a dial indicator with a scale that can be read accurately to 0025 mm with the zero reading being a flat surface S123 The 10 test positions on the image display consist of two positions at right angles to each other at each of five locations as shown in Figure 1 The locations are at the center of the mirror at the left and right ends of a horizontal line that bisects the mirror and at the top and bottom ends of a vertical line that bisects the mirror None of the readings are within a 64 mm border on the edge of the image display S124 At each position the spherometer is held perpendicular to the convex mirrorsurface and a record is made of the reading on the dial indicator to the nearest 0025 mm S125 Convert the dial reading data for each of the 10 test positions to radius of curvature calculations using Table I Consider the change as linear for dial readings that fall between two numbers in Table I S126 Calculate the average radius of curvature by adding all 10 radius of curvature calculations and dividing by ten S127 Determine the numerical difference between the average radius of curvature and each of the 10 individual radius of curvature calculations determined in S125 S128 Calculate the greatest percentage deviation by

10 mph and is incremented 16 kmh 10 mph for each subsequent test run until ESC service brake application occurs or any of the truck tractors or buss wheels departs the lane The vehicle entrance speed at which ESC service brake application occurs is the Preliminary Reference Speed The Preliminary Reference Speed is determined for each direction Clockwise steering and counterclockwise steering During any test run if any of the wheels of the truck tractor or bus depart the lane at any point within the first 120 degrees of radius arc angle the test run is repeated at the same entrance speed If any of the wheels of the truck tractor or bus depart the lane again then four consecutive test runs are repeated at the same entrance speed 16 kmh 10 mph S7712 Reference Speed Determination Using the Preliminary Reference Speed determined in S7711 perform two series of test runs using the JTurn test maneuver to determine the Reference Speed The first series consists of four consecutive test runs performed using counterclockwise steering The second series consists of four consecutive test runs performed using clockwise steering During each test run the driver attempts to maintain a speed equal to the Preliminary Reference Speed throughout the JTurn test maneuver The Reference Speed is the minimum entrance speed at which ESC service brake application occurs for at least two of four consecutive test runs of each series conducted at the same entrance speed within 16 kmh 10 mph The Reference Speed is determined for each direction clockwise steering and counterclockwise steering If ESC service brake application does not occur during at least two test runs of either series the Preliminary Reference Speed is increased by 16 kmh 10 mph and the procedure in this section is repeated

torque output and driver requested torque data collected from the vehicle communication network or CAN bus During the initial stages of each maneuver the two torque signals with respect to time will parallel each other Upon ESC engine torque reduction the two signals will diverge when the ESC system causes a commanded engine torque reduction and the driver depresses the accelerator pedal attempting to accelerate the vehicle S7721 Perform two series of test runs using the JTurn test maneuver at the Reference Speed determined in S7712 16 kmh 10 mph The first series consists of four consecutive test runs performed using counterclockwise steering The second series consists of four consecutive test runs performed using clockwise steering During each test run the driver fully depresses the accelerator pedal from the time when the vehicle crosses the start gate until the vehicle reaches the end gate S7722 During each of the engine torque reduction test runs verify the commanded engine torque and the driver requested torque signals diverge according to the criteria specified in S5321 S773 Roll Stability Control Test The vehicle is subjected to multiple series of test runs using the JTurn test maneuver in both the clockwise and the counterclockwise direction S7731 Before each test run the brake temperatures are monitored and the hottest brake is confirmed to be between 66 C 150 F and 204 C 400 F If the hottest brake temperature is not between 66 C 150 F and 204 C 400 F the brake temperature is adjusted in accordance with S742 S7732 During each test run the driver will release the accelerator pedal after the ESC system has slowed vehicle by more than 48 kmh 30 mph below the entrance speed S7733 The maximum test speed is the greater of 130 percent of the Reference Speed see S7712 or 48 kmh 30 mph The maximum test speed is determined for each direction clockwise steering and counterclockwise steering S7734 For each series of Roll Stability Control test runs the vehicle will perform eight consecutive test runs at the same entrance speed which is any speed between 48 kmh 30 mph and the maximum test speed determined according to S7733 S7735 Upon completion of testing post processing is done as specified in S79 S78 ESC Malfunction Detection S781 Simulate one or more ESC malfunctions by disconnecting the power source to any ESC component or

clothed in form fitting cotton stretch garments with short sleeves and midcalf length pants Each foot of the test dummy is equipped with a size 11EEE shoe which meets the configuration size sole and heel thickness specifications of MILS13192 1976 and weighs 057 009 kilograms 125 02 pounds S8273 Limb joints shall be set at between 1 and 2 gs Leg joints are adjusted with the torso in the supine position S8274 The stabilized temperature of the test dummy at the time of the side impact test shall be at any temperature between 206 degrees C and 222 degrees C S8275 The acceleration data from the accelerometers installed inside the skull cavity of the test dummy are processed according to the practices set forth in SAE Recommended Practice J211 March 1995 Instrumentation for Impact Tests Class 1000 S828 Positioning procedure for the Part 572 Subpart M test dummyvehicle to pole test The part 572 subpart M test dummy is initially positioned in the front outboard seating position on the struck side of the vehicle in accordance with the provisions of S121 of Standard 214 49 CFR 571214 and the vehicle seat is positioned as specified in S8321 and S8322 of that standard The position of the dummy is then measured as follows Locate the horizontal plane passing through the dummy head center of gravity Identify the rearmost point on the dummy head in that plane Construct a line in the plane that contains the rearward point of the front door daylight opening and is perpendicular to the longitudinal vehicle centerline Measure the longitudinal distance between the rearmost point on the dummy head and this line If this distance is less than 50 mm 2 inches or the point is not forward of the line then the seat andor dummy positions is adjusted as follows First the seat back angle is adjusted a maximum of 5 degrees until a 50 mm 2 inches distance is achieved If this is not sufficient to produce the 50 mm 2 inches distance the seat is moved forward until the 50 mm 2 inches distance is achieved or until the knees of the dummy contact the dashboard or knee bolster whichever comes first If the required distance cannot be achieved through movement of the seat the seat back angle is adjusted even further forward until the 50 mm 2 inches distance is obtained or until the seat back is in its fully upright locking position S9 Orthogonal Reference System The approach angles specified in S8134 are determined using the reference system specified in S91 through S94 S91 An orthogonal reference system consisting of a longitudinal X axis and a transverse Y axis in the same horizontal plane and a vertical Z axis through the intersection of X and Y is used to define the horizontal direction of approach of the headform The XZ plane is the vertical longitudinal zero plane and is parallel to the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle The XY plane is the horizontal zero plane parallel to the ground The YZ plane is the vertical transverse zero plane that is perpendicular to the XY and XZ planes The X coordinate is negative forward of the YZ plane and positive to the rear The Y coordinate is negative to the left of the XZ plane and positive to the right The Z coordinate is negative below the XY plane and positive above it See Figure 1 S92 The origin of the reference system is the center of gravity of the headform at the time immediately prior to launch for each test S93 The horizontal approach angle is the angle between the X axis and the headform impact velocity vector projected onto the horizontal zero plane measured in the horizontal zero plane in the counterclockwise direction A 0 degree horizontal vector and a 360 degree horizontal vector point in the positive X direction a 90 degree horizontal vector points in the positive Y direction a 180 degree horizontal vector points in the negative X direction and a 270 horizontal degree vector points in the negative Y direction See Figure 2 S94 The vertical approach angle is the angle between the horizontal plane and the velocity vector measured in the midsagittal plane of the headform A 0 degree vertical vector in Table I coincides with the horizontal plane and a vertical vector of greater than 0 degrees in Table I makes an upward angle of the same number of degrees with that plane S10 Target Locations a The target locations specified in S101 through S1016 are located on both sides of

the anvils consists of a solid mass of at least 300 pounds 1361 kg the outer surface of which consists of a steel plate with minimum thickness of 1 inch 25 cm and minimum surface area of 1 ft 2929 cm2 S7112 The drop system restricts side movement during the impact attenuation test so that the sum of the areas bounded by the accelerationtime response curves for both the x and yaxes horizontal axes is less than five percent of the area bounded by the accelerationtime response curve for the vertical axis S72 Penetration test S721 The penetration test is conducted by dropping the penetration test striker in guided free fall with its axis aligned vertically onto the outer surface of the complete helmet when mounted as specified in S63 at any point above the test line described in S623 except on a fastener or other rigid projection S722 Two penetration blows are applied at least 3 inches 76 cm apart and at least 3 inches 76 cm from the centers of any impacts applied during the impact attenuation test S723 The application of the two penetration blows specified in S722 starts at two minutes and is completed by four minutes after removal of the helmet from the conditioning environment S724 The height of the guided free fall is 1181 06 in 3 0015 m as measured from the striker point to the impact point on the outer surface of the test helmet S725 The contactable surface of the penetration test headform is constructed of a metal or metallic alloy having a Brinell hardness number no greater than 55 which will permit ready detection should contact by the striker occur The surface is refinished if necessary before each penetration test blow to permit detection of contact by the striker S726 The weight of the penetration striker is not less than 6 pounds 8 ounces and not more than 6 pounds 12 ounces 295 to 306 kg S727 The point of the striker has an included angle of 60 05 a cone height of 15 0015 in 38 0038 cm a tip radius of 002 0004 in 05 01 mm and a minimum hardness of 60 Rockwell Cscale S728 The rigid mount for the penetration test headform is as described in S7111 S73 Retention system test S731 The retention system test is conducted by applying a quasistatic tensile load at any rate from 04 to and including 12 inchmin from 10 to and including 30 cmmin to the retention assembly of a complete helmet which is mounted as described in S63 on a stationary test headform as shown in Figure 4 and by measuring the movement of the adjustable portion of the retention system test device under tension S732 The retention system test device consists of both an adjustable loading mechanism by which a quasistatic tensile load is applied at any rate from 04 to and including 12 inchmin from 10 to and including 30 cmmin to the helmet retention assembly and a means for holding the test headform and helmet stationary The retention assembly is fastened around two freely moving rollers both of which have a 05 inch 13 cm diameter and a 3 inch 76 cm centertocenter separation and which are mounted on the adjustable portion of the tensile loading device Figure 4 The helmet is fixed on the test headform as necessary to ensure that it does not move during the application of the test loads to the retention assembly S733 A 50pound 227 kg preliminary test load is applied to the retention assembly normal to the basic plane of the test headform and symmetrical with respect to the center of the retention assembly for 30 seconds and the maximum distance from the extremity of the adjustable portion of the retention system test device to the apex of the helmet is measured S734 An additional 250pound 1134 kg test load is applied to the retention assembly in the same manner and at the same location as described in S733 for 120 seconds and the maximum distance from the extremity of the adjustable portion of the retention system test device to the apex of the helmet is measured APPENDIX TO 571218 TABLE 1WEIGHT RANGES FOR IMPACT

Vehicles with partitions or bulkheads If a vehicle has a fixed transverse partition or bulkhead behind which there are no designated seating positions a vertical transverse vehicle plane 25 mm forward of the most forward portion of the partition or bulkhead defines the rearward edge of the offset line for the purposes of determining target locations when said plane is forward of the limiting plane defined in S5212a or b S522 Preliminary target locations a To identify the impact target locations the following procedures are performed with the x and z axes of the target shown in Figure 1 provided for illustration purposes aligned within 1 degree of the vehicle longitudinal and vertical axes respectively and the target y axis pointing in the outboard direction b Place targets at any location inside the offsetline where the target is tangent to within 2 mm of the offsetline at just two or three points see Figure 2 figure provided for illustration purposes S523 Determination of primary target locations Divide the side daylight opening into four quadrants by passing a vertical line and a horizontal line in a vehicle vertical longitudinal plane through the geometric center of the side daylight opening S5231 Front windows For any side daylight opening forward of the vehicle Bpillar the primary quadrants are the forwardlower and rearwardupper S5232 Rear windows For any side daylight opening rearward of the Bpillar the primary quadrants are the forwardupper and rearwardlower S5233 If a primary quadrant contains only one target center that target is the primary target for that quadrant see Figure 3 figure provided for illustration purposes If there is more than one target center in a primary quadrant the primary target for that quadrant is the lowest target in a lower quadrant and the highest target in an upper quadrant If there is a primary quadrant that does not contain a target center the target center closest to the primary quadrant outline is the primary target S524 Determination of secondary target locations S5241 Front windows Measure the horizontal distance between the centers of the primary targets For a side daylight opening forward of the Bpillar place one secondary target center rearward of the forward primary target by onethird of the horizontal distance between the primary target centers and tangent with upper portion of the offsetline Place another secondary target center rearward of the forward primary target by twothirds of the horizontal distance between the primary target centers and tangent with the lower portion of the offsetline see figure 4 figure provided for illustration purposes S5242 Rear windows For side daylight openings rearward of the Bpillar place one secondary target center rearward of the forward primary target by onethird of the horizontal distance between the primary target centers and tangent with lower portion of the offsetline Place another secondary target center rearward of the forward primary target by twothirds of the horizontal distance between the primary target centers and tangent with the upper portion of the offsetline see Figure 4 figure provided for illustration purposes S525 Target adjustment S5251 Target elimination and reconstitution S52511 Target elimination Determine the horizontal and vertical distance between the centers of the targets If the minimum distance between the z axes of the targets is less than 135 mm and the minimum distance between the x axes of the targets is less than 170 mm eliminate the targets in the order of priority given in steps 1 through 4 of Table 1 see Figure 5 5a and 5b figures provided for illustration purposes In each case both the z axes of the targets must be closer than 135 mm and x axes of the targets must be closer than 170 mm If the minimum distance between the z axes of the targets is not less than 135 mm or the minimum distance between the x axes of the targets is not less than 170 mm do not eliminate the target Continue checking all the targets listed in steps 1 through 4 of Table 1 TABLE 1PRIORITY LIST OF TARGET DISTANCE TO BE CHECKED AGAINST LIMITS Measure distance from z axis to z axis and x axis to x Step axis for these targets 1 Upper Secondary to Lower Secondary 2 Upper Primary to Upper or Remaining Secondary 3 Lower Primary to Lower or Remaining Secondary 4 Upper Primary to Lower Primary Eliminate this target if distances between z axes of targets and x axes of targets are less than 135 mm and 170 mm respectively Upper Secondary Upper or Remaining Secondary Lower or Remaining Secondary Upper Primary S52512 Target reconstitution If after following the procedure given in S52511 there are only two targets remaining determine the absolute distance between the centers of these targets If this distance is greater than or equal to 360 mm place a target such that its center bisects a line connecting the centers of the remaining targets S5252 Target reorientation90 degree rotation If after following the procedure given in S5251 there are less than four targets in a side daylight opening repeat the procedure in 52 through 52512 with a modification to S52 as follows Reorient the target by rotating it 90 degrees about the y axis of the target such that the target positive z axis is aligned within 1 degree of the vehicle longitudinal axis pointing in the direction of the vehicle positive x axis see Figures 5a and 5b figures provided for illustration purposes If after performing the procedure in this section the remaining targets exceed the number of targets determined with the original orientation of the target the reoriented targets represent the final target locations for the side daylight opening S5253 Target reorientation incremental rotation If after following the procedure given in S5252 there are no targets in a side daylight opening starting with the target in the position defined in S522a reorient the target by rotating it in 5 degree increments about the y axis of the target by rotating the target positive z axis toward the vehicle positive x axis At each increment of rotation attempt to fit the target within the offset line of the side daylight opening At the first increment of rotation where the target will fit place the target center as close as possible to the geometric center of the side daylight opening If more than one position exists that is closest to the geometric center of the side daylight opening select the lowest S53 Determination of zero displacement plane The glazing covering the target location of the side daylight opening being tested is intact and in place in the case of fixed glazing and intact and fully closed in the case of movable glazing With the ejection impactor targeting point aligned within 2 mm of the center of any target location specified in S52 and with the ejection impactor on the inside of the vehicle slowly move the impactor towards the window until contact is made with the interior of the glazing with no more than 20 N of pressure being applied to the window The location of the most outboard surface of the headform establishes the zero displacement plane for this target location S54 Window position and conditionSubject to S55b prior to impact testing the glazing covering the target location must be removed from the side daylight opening fully retracted or prebroken according to the procedure in S541 at the vehicle manufacturers option S541 Window glazing prebreaking procedure S5411 Breakage pattern Locate the geometric center of the side daylight opening established in S523 of this standard Mark the outside surface of the window glazing in a horizontal and vertical grid of points separated by 752 mm with one point coincident within 2 mm of the geometric center of the side daylight opening see Figure 6 figure provided for illustration purposes Mark the inside surface of the window glazing in a horizontal and vertical grid of points separated by 752 mm with the entire grid horizontally offset by 375 2 mm from the grid of points on the outside of the glazing S5412 Breakage method a Start with the inside surface of the window and forwardmost lowest mark made as specified in S5411 of this standard Use a center punch in this procedure The punch tip has a 5 2 mm diameter prior to coming to a point The spring is adjusted to require 150 25 N
